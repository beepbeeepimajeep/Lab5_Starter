# Lab 5 - Starter
Names: Rain van Eetveldt, Luis Zaragoza

## Rain's notes:
- No comments allowed in package.json
- The package.json file is: Part of the Node.js development setup which is used to define: Project metadata (name, version), Scripts (like npm test) and dependencies (like Jest for testing).

## Luis's notes:
- Completed the explore.js file using the documentation as a template then adding the face changes

## Check your understanding 
1. No the unit test would not be used to test the "message" feature of a message application because it cannot test how individual components, the writing, sending, and recieveing components, interact with eachother.
2. Yes you could have a test for the max length. The test would only require one component to test, the message creation, and thus a unit test would work.
